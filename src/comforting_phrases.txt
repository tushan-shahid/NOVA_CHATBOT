Take as much time as you need, I'm here for you. 
Try to focus on your breathing, I'm listening. 
Remember that our emotions are like waves: they come and go. 
It's good that you're opening up about this.
It's healthy to express how you feel, rather than keep it all in.
Thank you for sharing this with me, this is a safe space.
